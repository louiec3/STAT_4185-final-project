# STAT_4185-final-project
Final Project for Special Topics In Advanced Data Manipulation at UConn.

The project can be found in the project.ipynb file. Included will be code used to create the datasets, pre-process the data, visualizations, and the models with their evaluations. Throughout the notebook are comments to guide you through my thought process and analysis. 

As an overview, I attempted to create my own dataset of NFL players and their salaries pulling information from multiple sources and merging them together to get a "complete" dataset. 

The goal of this project was to create a model that predicts the salaries of NFL players based on their physical attributes, history, and NFL stats. As I went through the process, I realized some oversights on the acquired data that is noted in the notebook. Overall, I learned a lot about how to collect (most notably, I really appriciated the lessons on how to scrape for data on the web using the inspector gadget and BeautifulSoup), pre-process data and make a model and straties on how to improve it such has over/undersampling, . Though if I went back and improved the dataset, I think I would be able to make a more accurate model.
